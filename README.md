## Pilot HDC Lite

A lightweight, single-VM lite version of the [Pilot-HDC](https://hdc.humanbrainproject.eu/) platform. This lite version is designed for:
- Scientific researchers and small labs
- Internal development teams
- CI/CD and demo environments
- Local testing and evaluation

### Key Features
- **One-script deployment**: `./bootstrap.sh` sets up the complete platform
- **Resource efficient**: Runs on 16GB RAM / 4-6 vCPU / 100GB disk
- **Offline capable**: Works without external dependencies after initial setup
- **Production patterns**: Uses same Terraform + Helm deployment as full platform

### Architecture
- **k3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution
- **Keycloak**: User authentication and SSO
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and application databases
- **Redis**: Session and cache management
- **Kafka + Elasticsearch**: Data processing pipeline (utility namespace)

### Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ubuntu/Debian-based VM with sudo access
   - 16GB+ RAM, 4-6 vCPU, 100GB disk
   - Network connectivity for initial image pulls

2. **Create `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   EXTERNAL_IP=192.168.1.100  # Your VM IP
   RSA_PUBLIC_KEY="<your-public-key>"
   DEMO=true  # Required: Set to 'true' to accept self-signed certificates
              # ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY: Skips TLS verification during Terraform bootstrap
              # Only use on isolated/trusted networks (dev/demo environments)
              # For production: Configure proper CA-signed certificates and set DEMO=false

   # Keycloak admin console credentials
   KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USERNAME="myadminuser"  # **CHANGE THIS**
   KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD="SecurePass123"  # **REQUIRED**

   # Portal login credentials
   KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_TEST_USERNAME="testadmin"  # **CHANGE THIS**
   KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_TEST_PASSWORD="PortalPass456"  # **REQUIRED**
   ```

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Requirements**:
   - **Keycloak Admin Console** (`https://keycloak.<EXTERNAL_IP>.nip.io`):
     - Username: `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USERNAME` (do NOT use 'admin' or 'user')
     - Password: `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (required - deployment fails if not set)
   - **Portal Login** (`https://<EXTERNAL_IP>.nip.io`):
     - Username: `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_TEST_USERNAME` (default: 'testadmin')
     - Password: `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_TEST_PASSWORD` (required - deployment fails if not set)

   **Note**: This platform uses self-signed certificates from cert-manager. You must set `DEMO=true` to allow Terraform to deploy. See [Demo Mode Configuration](#demo-mode-configuration) below.

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

4. **Access**:
   - Keycloak: `https://keycloak.<EXTERNAL_IP>.nip.io`
   - MinIO Console: `https://minio-console.<EXTERNAL_IP>.nip.io`

## Security Considerations

### Demo Mode Configuration

This project uses a `DEMO` environment variable to control Terraform provider behavior during deployment.

#### What DEMO Mode Controls

**DEMO=false (Default - Secure by Default)**
- Terraform provider requires CA-signed certificates
- Use this when you have proper PKI infrastructure
- Deployment will fail with self-signed certificates
- **This is the secure default** - forces explicit security decisions

**DEMO=true (Development with Self-Signed Certificates)**
- Terraform provider accepts self-signed certificates from cert-manager
- **Required for this platform** since it uses cert-manager self-signed certs
- Enables quick setup without needing proper PKI infrastructure
- Explicit opt-in for relaxed TLS verification during deployment
- **NOTE**: User authentication flows always use HTTPS regardless of this setting

#### ‚úÖ What's Always Secured (Regardless of DEMO Mode)

- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All user-facing traffic uses HTTPS via cert-manager
- **Authentication Security**: OAuth2/OIDC flows always use HTTPS endpoints only
- **No HTTP Fallbacks**: HTTP redirects and origins are disabled for auth flows
- **Self-signed Certificates**: Managed by cert-manager ClusterIssuer
- **Secret Management**: Credentials stored in Kubernetes secrets
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative, auditable configuration

#### üîí Hardening for Production Use

If deploying this platform for real workloads, implement these additional measures:

1. **Network Isolation**
   - Deploy on isolated private network or VPN
   - Configure firewall rules (allow only 80/443)
   - Use network policies for pod-to-pod isolation

2. **Certificate Management**
   - Replace self-signed certs with CA-signed certificates
   - Use Let's Encrypt for public endpoints
   - Implement proper certificate rotation

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Configure LDAP/Active Directory integration
   - Implement proper RBAC policies
   - Enable audit logging
   - Set up MFA for admin accounts

4. **Data Protection**
   - Enable encryption at rest for persistent volumes
   - Configure backup and disaster recovery
   - Implement data retention policies
   - **Terraform State Security**: The local Terraform state file (`/home/ubuntu/.terraform-state/pilot-hdc-lite.tfstate`) contains sensitive data including database passwords. For production:
     - Use remote state backend (S3, Azure Blob, etc.) with encryption
     - Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
     - Restrict access to state files using IAM policies
     - Never commit state files to version control

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
   - Configure centralized logging
   - Set up security alerts

### Reporting Security Issues

This is a demo/development platform. For production deployments, conduct a thorough security review appropriate to your organization's requirements and compliance needs.
